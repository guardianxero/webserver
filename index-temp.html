          <p>Well, it's clearly been a while since I last posted on here. I've been busy recently with midterms or what not, but I now have a moment of free time to update this blog. Last weekend, I went with a few friends to the Launch Hackathon hosted by Capital One Labs. This was only my second hackathon, so I wasn't so sure what they would be like. At my first hackathon, the Facebook one, there was a clear focus on 'cool' hacks that were technically challenging and entertaining. But that might've been because the hackathon was meant for university students. At this hackathon, everything was meant to be monetized. It didn't matter if an application was technically challenging or hard if it had no commercial value, but an application that was simple to make that could be quickly monetized would have a much better chance of winning.</p>
          <p>I really saw this when we got to have a chat with Jason Calacanis about our project. His questions were all focused around, 'How can this be profitable?' or 'What could you do to commercialize this?'. It was a very entrepreneurial mindset, where the focus was less on challenging tasks but more on simple innovations. Jason even asked us if we would drop out of school if we won one of these hackathons with a $20,000 investment prize, which was something none of us had ever thought about. I really think this entrepreneurial mindset, though, is what drives the fast development of technology in California and worldwide, and I think it's a good thing that these hackathons promote this idea of innovation.</p>

          <p>Since my first day in elementary school, I've always been on the learning side of education. It was always others teaching me ideas, helping me with questions, and providing me guidance to further my pursuit of knowledge. A couple of days ago, though, one of the teaching assistants in my Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programs class sent out a message offering to teach a group of students recursion and how to teach recursion if they were willing to volunteer as lab assistants for an extra weekend study session. I mean, I always helped out my friends with their homework before starting at Berkeley, but never did I have the chance to be an assistant for an actual class! Seeing this golden opportunity to learn something new, I immediately emailed the TA to volunteer. </p>
          <p>I'm not sure if it was because Andrew really liked my application, or just because so few people applied, but I was offered a chance to help out with this study session. The session was honestly very helpful to me as a person. Not only did it help me understand the idea of teaching, it taught me how to best communicate with others. Andrew talked about how everything us, as humans, think about, has unlimited context; we all have various, small assumptions that we make when we explain ideas. The trick to efficiently communicating with someone, though, is to eliminate as many of these assumptions as possible, as assumptions that are true for myself were not exactly true for others.</p>
          <p>I also learned of the importance of empathizing with a student to help him. By listening to a student's reflection his approach to a programming problem and how he is stuck can really help me see from his perspective and really pinpoint methods of helping him succeed. Many times I had been trying to use general explanations to help my friends with homework back in high school, and now I see why that wouldn't be as effective sometimes. Everyone thinks differently, and sometimes my logic just doesn't match up with someone else's. using everything I had taken away from Andrew, I thoroughly enjoyed my 3 hours as a lab assistant helping others with computer science. Not only was it a satisfying experience, I feel like it not only improved my understanding of computer science, but it also improved my understanding of human communication.</p>

          <p>It's been a month since I started as an EECS major at Berkeley, and I had always been hearing about these fabled hackathons, where one goes to program day and night and end up with some magical program. Well, Facebook hosted one last weekend at their Menlo Park Headquarters, and sure enough, I jumped on this opportunity with a few of my friends and attended this gathering of nerds (yes, I'm and nerd and I'm PROUD OF IT). As this was my first hackathon, I wasn't quite sure what was going on, but my friends and I decided on writing a Google Chrome extension and disregarded the fact that none of us had experience with Javascript. Starting from nothing, we treaded through Javascript documentation, tested various Chrome API implementations, and spent hours debugging code. But we indeed made it to the end, and we had a prototype of an extension that would autosort open tabs while giving you notifications of updates on those open tabs. While it's not perfect, as many would say, "Something is always better than nothing!"</p>

          <p>I've been using the internet for a decent amount of time, and it's been a quite enjoyable experience. But this is the first time I will personally make my mark on the World Wide Web. This will be a mark where I can talk about my accomplishments, or venture to discuss happenings around the world, or just post random shenanigans that I happen to stumble upon. On that note, I do quite enjoy living a life to it's fullest, and I shall go about doing that now.</p>
